> Zheng He's fleet fixed its position by the stars; an AI fleet fixes its position by facts.

**One long-lived AI session (the captain) runs a fleet of terminal AI workers: dispatch, acceptance, merge, deploy, stakeholder relay, away-mode handover — and turns its judgement into rules you can assess.** Not a framework: a playbook that ran a real project for weeks, plus the scripts that hold it up.

## Run it in 5 minutes

tmux + python3 only:

```bash
export FLEET_HOME=/tmp/fleet
bash quickstart/demo.sh
```

A 15-step loop: dispatch → deliver → build → receipt → accept → ask → answer → unlock. Tutorial: [quickstart/README.en.md](quickstart/README.en.md).

## Captain Benchmark · three models measured

Same question bank (captain-v1, 157 checkpoints), same examiner, all four layers:

| Model | Platform | Overall | K1 – K9 | Verdict |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| GPT-6 Astra | Codex CLI 0.153.4 · 原生隔离会话 | **85.6** | 88 / 81 / 96 / 100 / 57 / 83 / 83 / 87 / 97 | not passed (veto: none) |
| grok-4.6 | Grok CLI 1.0.25 · headless | **82.2** | 82 / 60 / 96 / 92 / 62 / 75 / 100 / 91 / 97 | not passed (veto: none) |
| DeepSeek V4.1 Flash | Grok CLI 1.0.25 / provider: deepseek-flash | **76.2** | 74 / 62 / 79 / 88 / 55 / 100 / 75 / 91 / 78 | not passed (veto: none) |

![Nine abilities](docs/img/bench/bench-abilities.svg)

![Overall and layers](docs/img/bench/bench-overall.svg)

The overall score is not the only number: nine abilities are scored separately (K1 role discipline 20%, K2 crew profiling & dispatch 15%, K3 recovery without native monitors 10%, K4 task-book quality 10%, K5 long-run & handover 10%, K6–K9 see the bank). Hard-mode thresholds are overall ≥90, K1 ≥95, others ≥85 — none of the three passes yet. Grok 4.6 and GPT-6 Astra are the S04 simulator-false-rejection calibrated versions (raw scores kept).

## Who it is for

- **Forward Deployed Engineers**: one person driving many parallel workstreams on a customer site with an AI fleet — dispatching, accepting, relaying to customer roles, getting decisions to the customer's boss, leaving an auditable trail, handing over at any time.
- Independent developers and small-team tech leads who want several AI sessions to cooperate for a long time without losing control.

## Six principles

1. The captain judges, never writes business code; crew failure is normal, captain self-inflicted incidents are the real failures.
2. A receipt is not a fact, the artifact is; every criterion must answer "under what condition would it go red".
3. Stop and ask the Owner only for irreversible production actions, business facts only a human knows, and outward publication.
4. Every pending question goes on the decision panel; an answer unlocks tasks.
5. Monitors report only the dangerous side and only transitions, and never poll.
6. Lessons become case files and gates the same day; overnight they are lost.

## Before sharing

`tools/scrub-gate.sh` must pass (the term list and salt live outside the repo; without them the gate degrades to structural checks only).
